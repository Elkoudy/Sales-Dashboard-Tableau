### 4. Profitability  
The dashboard utilizes color coding to differentiate between profit and loss within each subcategory. This visual distinction provides insight into the profitability of various product categories.

### 5. Dashboard Creation Process  
Images from the source document show the process of building the dashboard, from dragging and dropping data fields to creating bar charts, line graphs, and tables. The final dashboard offers a comprehensive view of sales data.
